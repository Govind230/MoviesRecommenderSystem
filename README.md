# MoviesRecommenderSystem
**Movie Recommendation System in Python using Machine Learning 

These suggestions or recommendations are done by a system called a recommendation system.
This engine makes suggestions by learning and understanding the patterns in your watch history (letâ€™s say) 
and then applies those patterns and findings to make new suggestions.

**About Movie Recommendation Project

In this machine learning project, we build a recommendation system from the ground up to suggest movies to the
user based on his/her preferences.

**Project Dataset

There are several datasets available to build a movie recommendation system. 
But for this project, we are going to use a dataset from tmdb website and extract the useful data 
as per our project metadata (movie_id,genres,cast, crew, etc..) of the movie.
